Text-extraction-invoices
=====================

The objective is to be able to extract the text from an invoice while maintaining its structure. 
The code also performs well for a poor quality invoice by using an upscaling model developed [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/202-vision-superresolution).
